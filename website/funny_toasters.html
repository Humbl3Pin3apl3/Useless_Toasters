  <p>What you are about to see, is going to be a collection of toaster images, 
    that have been recently found by me on the internet. They are not connected 
    between each other in any possible way, they are just random images. Some of 
    them will probably have cats in them, because why not. Some of them will not 
    have cat images in them, because otherwise I would have had to name the 
    website "cat-toasters" </p>

    <h1>How does a toaster work?</h1>
    <p>A toaster works by using electricity to heat nichrome wires, which 
      glow red and emit infrared radiation to toast bread, while a 
      mechanical/electrical timer system holds the bread down and pops it 
      up when done, relying on the Maillard reaction for browning and 
      flavor. When you press the lever, it completes an electrical circuit, 
      activating the heating elements; a timer (often a bimetallic strip or 
      electronic circuit) controls the duration, then releases a 
      spring-loaded tray, ejecting the toast. </p>
